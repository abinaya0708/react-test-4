        1.What is React Router?     

        =>Create React App doesn't include page routing.
        =>React Router is the most popular solution.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        2.Differentiate between state and props?
        
        => Props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component, while state is used to manage data within a component. Props are immutable and cannot be changed within a component, while state is mutable and can be updated using the setState function.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        3.Why should we not update the state directly?  

        =>Updating the state of a component directly can have unintended consequences that can be difficult to debug. If the state is updated directly as in the example above, the component will not rerender since the state is compared shallowly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        4.What is Param and Search Params? Write one example?    

        =>Param->React JS useParams Hook helps to access the parameters of the current route to manage the dynamic routes in the URL. The react-router-dom package has useParams hooks that let you access and use the parameters of the current route as required.

        Eg:import React from "react";
        import { Link, useParams } from "react-router-dom";
        
        export const Serve = () =>{
        let {id,age} = useParams()
        console.log(id,age)
        return(
        < div>
        Serve
        Link to="/">go to banner /Link>
        < /div>
        )
        
        }

        =>Searchparam->Way to pass state through the URL. They are part of the URL that comes after a question mark ?, and they consist of key/value pairs separated by &.

        Eg:import React from "react";
        import { Link, useSearchParams } from "react-router-dom";
        
        export const Login = () =>{
        let [param]= useSearchParams()
        console.log(param.get('id'))
        console.log(param.get('name'))
        return(
        < div>
        Login
        Link to='/Ser/jaishree/24'>Go to Serve /Link>
        < /div>
        )
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        5.What is the difference between HTML and React event handling?

        =>In HTML, event names are written in lowercase, however in React, they are written in camelCase.

        =>In HTML, we may avoid default behavior by returning false, but in React, we must call preventDefault() explicitly
        
        =>In HTML, the function is called by inserting "()" to the function name. If we don't want to utilize this way, we may use addEventLisener to provide events and listeners, however in React, we require the method name without the "()" appended.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        6.Differentiate between Real DOM and Virtual DOM?

        =>The fundamental contrast between the DOM and Virtual DOM is that the DOM represents the actual HTML structure of a web page, while the Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the DOM used by React to enhance performance while updating the actual DOM.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        7.What are the advantages of react?

        =>React JS is open-source Javascript library used for building single page web applications.

        =>Some features of react->Virtual DOM,JSX,one-way data binding,React native,Declarative UI,Component-based architecture,speed and efficiency,Flexibility

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        8.What are the different phases of React componentâ€™s lifecycle? 

        =>In React, components have a lifecycle that consists of different phases. Each phase has a set of lifecycle methods that are called at specific points in the component's lifecycle. These methods allow you to control the component's behavior and perform specific actions at different stages of its lifecycle.
        A component's lifecycle has three main phases: 
        i)Initializing. This is the initial phase of the React component lifecycle. ...
        ii)Mounting. (componentDidMount(): The method invoked immediately after the component is positioned on the DOM, i.e. right after the component is rendered on the screen for the very first time)
        iii)Updating. ...(componentDidUpdate(): The method invoked immediately after the component is re-rendered after updating the states and/or properties.)
        (shouldComponentUpdate(): The method invoked before deciding whether the newly rendered props are required to be displayed on the webpage or not)
        iV)Unmounting.(The method invoked immediately before the component is removed from the DOM)
